# First-Assignment
This is your first assignment!

Eek! First assignment! So scary. Your first assignment is this:

1) edit this file and add your name and e-mail to the list below!

2) make a website.

3) make a repository in the GitHub organization and upload your website code.

These are all new skills. Try and Google around if you get stuck, or e-mail me!
